# EZ-API-Wrapper-Package
Wrapper for an API: If there's an API you frequently use, ou could simply use our EZ-API-Wrapper-Package for it that simplifies the process of making requests and handling responses. This could be for anything from weather data to social media APIs.

## Installation:
First, the user needs to install the package in their project. They can do this using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install ez-api-wrapper
```
or

```bash
yarn add ez-api-wrapper
```
## Importing:
Once installed, the user can import the required functions or modules from the package into their project files where they need to interact with the API.


```javascript
// Import the API client module
const { fetchData, fetchPosts, fetchUsers } = require('ez-api-wrapper');
```

## Usage:
Next, the user can use the imported functions or modules to interact with the API. For example, they can fetch posts or users from the API:


```javascript
// Example usage: Fetch posts from the API
const posts = await fetchPosts('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com');

// Example usage: Fetch users from the API
const users = await fetchUsers('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com');
```
## Error Handling:
It's important for the user to handle errors gracefully when using the package functions. They can use try-catch blocks to catch any errors that may occur during API requests:

```javascript
try {
    const posts = await fetchPosts('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com');
    // Handle successful response
} catch (error) {
    // Handle error
    console.error('Error fetching posts:', error.message);
}
```
## Customization:
Users can customize the behavior of the EZ-API-Wrapper-Package according to their needs by passing different parameters to the functions or by modifying the package source code if necessary.

## Testing:
Finally, users can write tests to ensure that the package functions behave as expected in different scenarios. They can use testing frameworks like Mocha or Jest to write and run tests for the package functions.

### A code snippet how a user imports and uses API wrapper package to fetch posts from an API: ##

```javascript
// Import the API wrapper package
const { fetchPosts } = require('ez-api-wrapper');

// Define the API URL
const apiUrl = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com';

// Function to fetch posts from the API
async function getPosts() {
    try {
        // Fetch posts from the API using the package function
        const posts = await fetchPosts(apiUrl);
        
        // Log the fetched posts
        console.log('Fetched posts:', posts);
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle errors
        console.error('Error fetching posts:', error.message);
    }
}

// Call the function to fetch posts
getPosts();

```

## Using EZ-API-Wrapper-Package:

### Pros:

- Abstraction: Users don't need to worry about the low-level details of making HTTP requests and handling responses. Your package abstracts away the complexities.
- Simplicity: Users can easily interact with the API using intuitive functions provided by your package, reducing the amount of boilerplate code they need to write.
- Consistency: Your package ensures consistent behavior across different API endpoints and standardizes error handling, making it easier for users to work with multiple endpoints.
- Features: Your package may include additional features like caching, rate limiting, and batch requests, which can enhance performance and provide added functionality.

### Cons:

- Dependency: Users need to install and maintain your package as a dependency in their projects.
- Learning Curve: Users may need to spend some time learning how to use your package and understanding its API.

## Not Using Your API Wrapper Package:

### Pros:

- Control: Users have full control over how they interact with the API, allowing them to customize requests and responses according to their specific needs.
- Flexibility: Users can choose their preferred HTTP request library and implement custom error handling and caching strategies tailored to their project requirements.

### Cons:

- Boilerplate: Users need to write boilerplate code for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and dealing with errors. This can lead to code duplication and increased development time.
- Complexity: Dealing with low-level HTTP operations and error handling can introduce complexity and potential bugs, especially for developers less familiar with these concepts.
- Maintenance: Users are responsible for maintaining their own HTTP request code, which may require updates and adjustments over time as the project evolves or API changes occur.

Overall, using your EZ-API-Wrapper-Package offers convenience, consistency, and potentially improved performance through added features, while not using it provides greater control and flexibility but requires more effort in terms of implementation and maintenance. Users need to weigh these factors based on their project requirements and preferences.
